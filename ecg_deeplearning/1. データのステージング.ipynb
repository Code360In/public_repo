Database](https://physionet.org/physiobank/database/ptbdb/)からのデータを用いて、ECGデータをDelta Lakeへ格納する際にDatabricksレイクハウスプラットフォームが提供する機能をご説明します。これは4つあるノートブックの1つめとなります。このノートブックでは、PTBの研究で収集された人々のECGデータを示す[WFDB](https://wfdb.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)ファイルをダウンロードします。そして、データに対する機械学習、ストリーミング分析を行えるように、このデータを[Delta Lake](https://delta.io/)にロードします。\n\n最初に、AWS S3、Azure Blob Storage上に乗るメタデータ管理レイヤーの[DBFS](https://qiita.com/taka_yayoi/items/e16c7272a7feb5ec9a92)にデータをダウンロードします。マジックコマンド`%sh`を用いて、[Databricksノートブック上でシェルコマンドを実行](https://qiita.com/taka_yayoi/items/dfb53f63aed2fbd344fc#%E6%B7%B7%E6%88%90%E8%A8%80%E8%AA%9E)することができます。Physionetのウェブサイトからデータをダウンロードするためにシェルで`wget`コマンドを使用します。\n\n**参考資料**\n-
