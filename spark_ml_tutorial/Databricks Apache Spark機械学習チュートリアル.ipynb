データフレームをインプットとして新たなデータフレームを返却します。Transformersは、データから学習は行わず、モデル学習のためのデータを準備するか、学習したMLlibモデルで予測を行うために、単にルールベースの変換処理を適用します。`.transform()`メソッドでtransformerを呼び出すことができます。\n\n- **Estimator**: `.fit()`メソッドを用いてデータフレームからパラメーターを学習(fit)し、モデルを返却します。モデルはtransformerです。\n\n- **Pipeline**: 複数のステップを容易に実行できるように単一のワークフローにまとめます。機械学習モデル作成には、多くのケースで異なるステップが含まれ、それらを繰り返す必要があります。パイプラインを用いることでこのプロセスを自動化することができます。\n\n詳細はこちらを参照ください:\n[ML

カテゴリー変数を数値に変換する\n\n線形回帰、ロジスティック回帰などの学習アルゴリズムでは、特徴量が数値である必要があります。上記の成人データセットでは、教育、職業、既婚・未婚のデータがカテゴリー変数となっています。\n\n以下のコードでは、カテゴリー変数を0か1のみを取る数値変数に変換するために、どのように`StringIndexer`と`OneHotEncoder`を使用するのかを説明します。\n\n- `StringIndexer`は、文字列のカラムをラベルのインデックスに変換します。例えば、\"red\"、\"blue\"、\"green\"をそれぞれ0、1、2に変換します。 \n- `OneHotEncoder`は、カテゴリー変数のインデックスを二進数のベクトルにマッピングします。当該レコードのカテゴリー変数のインデックスに該当するベクトルの要素に\"1\"が割り当てられます。\n\nSparkにおけるOne-hotエンコーディングは2段階のプロセスとなります。最初にStringIndexerを使い、OneHotEncoderを呼び出します。以下のコードブロックでは、StringIndexerとOneHotEncoderを定義しますが、データにはまだ適用しません。\n\n詳細はこちらを参照ください:
