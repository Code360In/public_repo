We found in the ESRD group significantly higher GM-CSF and IL-2 levels at 6 h post-infection. However, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12p40, TNF-α, MCP-1, and MIP-1b levels were found significantly lower than in the control group. At 24 h, 48 h, and 72 h post-infection, significantly lower levels of IL-1Ra, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12p40, TNF-α, MCP-1, and MIP-1b were detected in ESRD group. Concentration of VEGF at 24 h and 48 h, and of GM-CSF at 48 h and 72 h were also found to be lower in ESRD group than in control group. Compared with controls, the viral load Ct values were significantly lower in ESRD group at 6 h and 24 h post-infection No significant difference in viral load Ct values between two groups was found at 48 h and 72 h post-infection.

We have reported that RL could inhibit the production of inflammatory mediators in immune cells. Here we investigated the effects and the mechanism of action of RL in collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) rats. RL significantly increased food intake and weight gain of CIA rats without any observable adverse effect; ameliorated joint erythema and swelling; inhibited immune cell infiltration, bone erosion and osteophyte formation in joints; reduced joint protein expression levels of TLR4, phospho-TAK1, phospho-NF-κB p65, phospho-c-Jun and phospho-IRF3; lowered levels of inflammatory factors (TNF-α, IL-6, IL-1β, IL-17A and MCP-1 in sera and TNF-α, IL-6, IL-1β and IL-17A in joints); elevated serum IL-10 level; reinvigorated activities of antioxidant SOD, CAT and GSH-Px in the liver and serum; reduced Th17 cell proportions in splenocytes; inhibited splenocyte proliferation and activation; and lowered serum IgG level. In conclusion, RL at nontoxic doses inhibited TLR4 signaling and potently improved clinical conditions of CIA rats. These findings provide further pharmacological justifications for the traditional use of RL in RA management, New Class of Monoclonal Antibodies against Severe Influenza: Prophylactic and Therapeutic Efficacy in Ferrets, High Rates of Detection of Respiratory Viruses in Tonsillar Tissues from Children with Chronic Adenotonsillar Disease, Association of the Human Bocavirus With Tonsil Squamous Cell Carcinomas, Print) 2225-2002 in Africa in the Global Health Security era, The cientificWorldJOURNAL Research Article Clinical Manifestations Vary with Different Age Spectrums in Infants with Kawasaki Disease, A mathematical model for simulating the phase-based transmissibility of a novel coronavirus, Glycosylator: a Python framework for the rapid modeling of glycans, Short Report: Molecular Detection of Adenoviruses, Rhabdoviruses, and Paramyxoviruses in Bats from Kenya, Detection of viral respiratory pathogens in mild and severe acute respiratory infections in Singapore To investigate the performance of laboratory methods and clinical case definitions in detecting the viral pathogens for acute respiratory infections (ARIs) from a prospective community cohort and hospital inpatients, nasopharyngeal swabs from cohort members reporting ARIs (community-ARI) and inpatients admitted with ARIs (inpatient-ARI) were tested by Singleplex Real Time-Polymerase Chain Reaction (SRT-PCR), multiplex RT-PCR (MRT-PCR) and pathogen-chip system (PathChip) between OPEN, Detection and genetic characterization of canine astroviruses in pet dogs in Guangxi, China, Aerosolized avian influenza virus by laboratory manipulations, Comparative Genomic Analysis of Classical and Variant Virulent Parental/Attenuated Strains of Porcine Epidemic Diarrhea Virus, Inhibitory effects of magnolol and honokiol on human calcitonin aggregation OPEN, Efficacy of a live attenuated vaccine in classical swine fever virus postnatally persistently infected pigs, Methanolic Extract of Rhizoma Coptidis Inhibits the Early Viral Entry Steps of Hepatitis C Virus Infection, Virology Journal Deletion of human metapneumovirus M2-2 increases mutation frequency and attenuates growth in hamsters, Whole-proteome phylogeny of large dsDNA viruses and parvoviruses through a composition vector method related to dynamical language model, Citation: Rabbit Hemorrhagic Disease Virus Non-structural Protein 6 Induces Apoptosis in Rabbit Kidney Cells, Protection against Amoebic Liver Abscess in Hamster by Intramuscular Immunization with an Autographa californica Baculovirus Driving the Expression of the Gal-Lectin LC3 Fragment, , Effect of oral care gel on the quality of life for oral lichen planus in patients with chronic HCV infection, Microbial sequencing to improve individual and population health, BMC Family Practice Accuracy of parents in measuring body temperature with a tympanic thermometer, Research in epidemic and emergency situations: A model for collaboration and expediting ethics review in two Caribbean countries Derrick Aarons, S)-Goitrin by SFC: An Application in Traditional Chinese Medicine, Identification of hepadnavirus in the sera of cats OPEN, Throat and nasal swabs for molecular detection of respiratory viruses in acute pharyngitis, Serologic and behavioral risk survey of workers with wildlife contact in China, Roles of the antioxidant properties of icariin and its phosphorylated derivative in the protection against duck virus hepatitis, Polypeptide N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase 2 regulates cellular metastasis-associated behavior in gastric cancer, Inhibits Uncoating of Influenza Virus, Pet cat hair implicates murder suspect, molecules In Vitro and in Vivo Studies of the Inhibitory Effects of Emodin Isolated from Polygonum cuspidatum on Coxsakievirus B 4, ): e38241. of China (2012ZX10002-004), National eleven-five project of China (2009ZX10004-314) and National Natural Science Foundation of China, Galloyl-Hexahydroxydiphenoyl (HHDP)-Glucose Isolated From Punica granatum L.

We found in the ESRD group significantly higher GM-CSF and IL-2 levels at 6 h post-infection. However, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12p40, TNF-α, MCP-1, and MIP-1b levels were found significantly lower than in the control group. At 24 h, 48 h, and 72 h post-infection, significantly lower levels of IL-1Ra, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12p40, TNF-α, MCP-1, and MIP-1b were detected in ESRD group. Concentration of VEGF at 24 h and 48 h, and of GM-CSF at 48 h and 72 h were also found to be lower in ESRD group than in control group. Compared with controls, the viral load Ct values were significantly lower in ESRD group at 6 h and 24 h post-infection No significant difference in viral load Ct values between two groups was found at 48 h and 72 h post-infection.

We have reported that RL could inhibit the production of inflammatory mediators in immune cells. Here we investigated the effects and the mechanism of action of RL in collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) rats. RL significantly increased food intake and weight gain of CIA rats without any observable adverse effect; ameliorated joint erythema and swelling; inhibited immune cell infiltration, bone erosion and osteophyte formation in joints; reduced joint protein expression levels of TLR4, phospho-TAK1, phospho-NF-κB p65, phospho-c-Jun and phospho-IRF3; lowered levels of inflammatory factors (TNF-α, IL-6, IL-1β, IL-17A and MCP-1 in sera and TNF-α, IL-6, IL-1β and IL-17A in joints); elevated serum IL-10 level; reinvigorated activities of antioxidant SOD, CAT and GSH-Px in the liver and serum; reduced Th17 cell proportions in splenocytes; inhibited splenocyte proliferation and activation; and lowered serum IgG level. In conclusion, RL at nontoxic doses inhibited TLR4 signaling and potently improved clinical conditions of CIA rats. These findings provide further pharmacological justifications for the traditional use of RL in RA management, New Class of Monoclonal Antibodies against Severe Influenza: Prophylactic and Therapeutic Efficacy in Ferrets, High Rates of Detection of Respiratory Viruses in Tonsillar Tissues from Children with Chronic Adenotonsillar Disease, Association of the Human Bocavirus With Tonsil Squamous Cell Carcinomas, Print) 2225-2002 in Africa in the Global Health Security era, The cientificWorldJOURNAL Research Article Clinical Manifestations Vary with Different Age Spectrums in Infants with Kawasaki Disease, A mathematical model for simulating the phase-based transmissibility of a novel coronavirus, Glycosylator: a Python framework for the rapid modeling of glycans, Short Report: Molecular Detection of Adenoviruses, Rhabdoviruses, and Paramyxoviruses in Bats from Kenya, Detection of viral respiratory pathogens in mild and severe acute respiratory infections in Singapore To investigate the performance of laboratory methods and clinical case definitions in detecting the viral pathogens for acute respiratory infections (ARIs) from a prospective community cohort and hospital inpatients, nasopharyngeal swabs from cohort members reporting ARIs (community-ARI) and inpatients admitted with ARIs (inpatient-ARI) were tested by Singleplex Real Time-Polymerase Chain Reaction (SRT-PCR), multiplex RT-PCR (MRT-PCR) and pathogen-chip system (PathChip) between OPEN, Detection and genetic characterization of canine astroviruses in pet dogs in Guangxi, China, Aerosolized avian influenza virus by laboratory manipulations, Comparative Genomic Analysis of Classical and Variant Virulent Parental/Attenuated Strains of Porcine Epidemic Diarrhea Virus, Inhibitory effects of magnolol and honokiol on human calcitonin aggregation OPEN, Efficacy of a live attenuated vaccine in classical swine fever virus postnatally persistently infected pigs, Methanolic Extract of Rhizoma Coptidis Inhibits the Early Viral Entry Steps of Hepatitis C Virus Infection, Virology Journal Deletion of human metapneumovirus M2-2 increases mutation frequency and attenuates growth in hamsters, Whole-proteome phylogeny of large dsDNA viruses and parvoviruses through a composition vector method related to dynamical language model, Citation: Rabbit Hemorrhagic Disease Virus Non-structural Protein 6 Induces Apoptosis in Rabbit Kidney Cells, Protection against Amoebic Liver Abscess in Hamster by Intramuscular Immunization with an Autographa californica Baculovirus Driving the Expression of the Gal-Lectin LC3 Fragment, , Effect of oral care gel on the quality of life for oral lichen planus in patients with chronic HCV infection, Microbial sequencing to improve individual and population health, BMC Family Practice Accuracy of parents in measuring body temperature with a tympanic thermometer, Research in epidemic and emergency situations: A model for collaboration and expediting ethics review in two Caribbean countries Derrick Aarons, S)-Goitrin by SFC: An Application in Traditional Chinese Medicine, Identification of hepadnavirus in the sera of cats OPEN, Throat and nasal swabs for molecular detection of respiratory viruses in acute pharyngitis, Serologic and behavioral risk survey of workers with wildlife contact in China, Roles of the antioxidant properties of icariin and its phosphorylated derivative in the protection against duck virus hepatitis, Polypeptide N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase 2 regulates cellular metastasis-associated behavior in gastric cancer, Inhibits Uncoating of Influenza Virus, Pet cat hair implicates murder suspect, molecules In Vitro and in Vivo Studies of the Inhibitory Effects of Emodin Isolated from Polygonum cuspidatum on Coxsakievirus B 4, ): e38241. of China (2012ZX10002-004), National eleven-five project of China (2009ZX10004-314) and National Natural Science Foundation of China, Galloyl-Hexahydroxydiphenoyl (HHDP)-Glucose Isolated From Punica granatum L.

class=\"ansiout\">Out[13]: &#34;Row(text=[&#39;Cowpox virus infections in captive cheetahs (Acinonyx jubatus) with high morbidity and mortality have already been reported in the UK and Russia in the 1970s. However, most of the reported cases have been singular events. Here, we report a total of five cowpox virus outbreaks in cheetahs in the same safari park in Denmark between 2010 and 2014. Nine cheetahs showed varying severity of clinical disease; two of them died (22%). All episodes occurred between August and October of the respective year. No other carnivores kept at the same institution nor the keepers taking care of the animals were clinically affected. The clinical picture of cowpox was confirmed by extensive laboratory investigations including histopathological and molecular analyses as well as cell culture isolation of a cowpox virus. High anti-orthopoxvirus antibody titers were detected in all 9 diseased cheetahs compared to seven contact cheetahs without clinical signs and 13 cheetahs not in direct contact. Additionally, whole genome sequencing from one sample of each cluster with subsequent phylogenetic analysis showed that the viruses from different outbreaks have individual sequences but clearly form a clade distinct from other cowpox viruses. However, the intra-clade distances are still larger than those usually observed within clades of one event.

However, most of the reported cases have been singular events. Here, we report a total of five cowpox virus outbreaks in cheetahs in the same safari park in Denmark between 2010 and 2014. Nine cheetahs showed varying severity of clinical disease; two of them died (22%). All episodes occurred between August and October of the respective year. No other carnivores kept at the same institution nor the keepers taking care of the animals were clinically affected. The clinical picture of cowpox was confirmed by extensive laboratory investigations including histopathological and molecular analyses as well as cell culture isolation of a cowpox virus. High anti-orthopoxvirus antibody titers were detected in all 9 diseased cheetahs compared to seven contact cheetahs without clinical signs and 13 cheetahs not in direct contact. Additionally, whole genome sequencing from one sample of each cluster with subsequent phylogenetic analysis showed that the viruses from different outbreaks have individual sequences but clearly form a clade distinct from other cowpox viruses. However, the intra-clade distances are still larger than those usually observed within clades of one event. These findings indicate multiple and separate introductions of cowpox virus, probably from wild rodent populations, where the virus keeps circulating naturally and is only sporadically introduced into the cheetahs. Sero-positivity of voles (Arvicola amphibious) caught in zoo grounds strengthens this hypothesis. As a consequence, recommendations are given for medical and physical management of diseased cheetahs, for hygienic measures as well as for pre-shipment isolation before cheetah export from zoo grounds.&#39;])&#34;</div>"]}}],"execution_count":0},{"cell_type":"code","source":["abstract2 = str(comm_use_subset.select(\"abstract.text\").take(2)[1])\nabstract2"],"metadata":{"application/vnd.databricks.v1+cell":{"title":"","showTitle":false,"inputWidgets":{},"nuid":"a94b0500-e9ee-47f0-a550-17826ffdc586"}},"outputs":[{"output_type":"display_data","metadata":{"application/vnd.databricks.v1+output":{"datasetInfos":[],"data":"<div class=\"ansiout\">Out[14]: &#34;Row(text=[&#39;The UniProt Knowledgebase is a collection of sequences and annotations for over 120 million proteins across all branches of life.
